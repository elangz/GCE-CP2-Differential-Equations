Suppose $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are solutions to a differential equation
$$ay''+by'+cy=f(x)$$
For all solutions, the following holds true: 
$$Y_1-Y_2=Ay_1+By_2$$
where $y_1$ and $y_2$ are a fundamental set of solutions to the differential equation. 

Now suppose $y$ is the general solution and $Y_P$ is any solution known to us: 
$$y-Y_P = Ay_1+By_2$$
$$y = Ay_1+By_2 + Y_P$$
Note that $Ay_1+By_2$ is complementary function, and $Y_P$ is the particular integral.
