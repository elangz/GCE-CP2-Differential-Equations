# GCE-CP2-Differential-Equations

Our maths teacher asked each of us to teach 1 chapter from book Pearson Edexcel GCE A-Level Further Mathematics Core Pure Mathematics Book 2. 

My chapter is on Differential Equations. I decided to make a slideshow using [Advanced Slides](https://github.com/MSzturc/obsidian-advanced-slides), a Plugin on Obsidian using reveal.js. 

Alongside with the main slides, there are also some proof sheets that are "insignicant" for the curriculum.
